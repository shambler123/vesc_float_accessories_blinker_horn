; ext-esp_led-* extensions. Strips sharing a pin are chained by offset.
;
; A strip's timing config doubles as its enable: 0 = disabled, 1+ = preset + 1.
; Highbeam mode 1 drives a PWM pin, mode 2 drives LEDs embedded in the strip as
; overlay pixels, at the positions packed one per byte in highbeam-pos, mapped
; onto the configured min-max drive range.

; Every LED setting, copied into the RAM cache the loop reads. Each name is both
; the config key and the variable it lands in, so this is a list and a loop rather
; than 55 assignments that could drift. Quoted, so the list lives in the const
; heap. Adding one: put the key here, declare the variable in led-vars.lisp.

; Animation cycle times in ms, one per pattern drawn on more than one strip.
;
; The lib offers two ways to pace an effect. spd is pixel velocity: phase gains
; spd units per 33 ms and each effect divides that by its own period, so Hz =
; spd * 30.3 / period (strobe 128 units, felony 96, breathe 2048, rainbow 4096,
; larson 32 * (leds - 1)). A cycle time instead pins one period to a wall-clock
; time, which is what the constants below are.
;
; Two reasons the patterns here use them. Larson could not be expressed as a
; speed at all - its period follows the LED count, so at one spd a 10 LED front
; turned around while a 15 LED rear was still two thirds of the way out, and the
; two beat against each other. And the lib treats segments sharing a cycle time
; as one animation: it holds them in step and lets one that was pulled away
; rejoin the rest, which is what survives the brake light claiming the rear on
; its own. So the value doubles as the identity of the pattern's set, and every
; strip showing a pattern joins that set whatever its length - which is why each
; pattern gets its own number and no two share one. Where the same pattern is
; drawn from several places (rave rainbow on front and rear, plain rainbow on
; front, rear, footpad and button) they all name the same constant on purpose.
;
; Only larson is a new rate. The rest are the rates the old spd values already
; produced - period * 33 / spd, within 0.1% - so nothing changes speed. At the
; 60 fps this package sets, a cycle spans cycle_ms / 16.7 frames and two is
; Nyquist: strobe once ran at 30 Hz on 2 frames and felony was undersampled, so
; keep 6+ frames (100 ms) per cycle.
;
; The gauge is deliberately absent: its renderer reads spd itself as the
; pulse-or-not flag, so moving it to a cycle time would silently stop the
; charging pulse. Its period does not follow the LED count anyway, so strips
; showing it are already in step.
